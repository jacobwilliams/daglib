Test Ouptut Directory
=====================
This directory exists to hold test output, which
can generally be considered temporary and removable.
This directory contains only
1. A `.gitignore` file that asks `git` to ignore all new files.
2. This README.md file that was force-added via `git add -f README.md`.
