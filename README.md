Overview
========

DAG is a Fortran 2018 library for creating and manipulating directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  DAG is based on a fork of [daglib by Jacob Williams], refactored to add

* A build system and test harness automated by [fpm],
* Unit testing written with [Vegetables], 
* Continuous-integration testing and documentation deployment via [GitHub Actions], 
* Documentation generated by [FORD], 
* Runtime assertion-checking using [Sourcery], and
* [JSON] file input/output using [jsonff].  

DAG includes a topological sort feature, and it generates files in the [GraphViz] "dot" format.

Prerequisites
-------------
DAG was developed with the following prerequisite package versions:

1. [gfortran] 10.2.0
2. [OpenCoarrays]  2.9.2
3. [fpm] 0.1.3
4. [graphviz] 2.44.1

Earlier versions might work also.

Building and testing
--------------------
After installing [fpm], clone, build, and test, execute the following in a `bash`-like shell:
```
git clone git@github.com:sourceryinstitute/dag
fpm test --compiler caf --runner "cafrun -n 1"
```
replacing `1` in the last line with the desired number of images to execute in parallel for
each test.  Please report any test failures by submitting an [issue] on the DAG repository.

Example
-------

The [jacob-example] test provides a short example of the use of dag, including checks
for the expected results.  That test also writes the following image to a `.pdf` file:
